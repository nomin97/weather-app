# Weather App

## Description
This application uses a server side API to populate a weather report for a inputted city. Although the key is no longer active and not working, the set up and functions are correct. A user can put in a city and get a five day report for that city including the the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity. Once a user inputs a city, that city is saved and there is a card for recent history using local storage.
